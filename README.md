# MinMaxScalerBytes

MinMaxScalerByte scales numeric integer sequences down to their lower limit, and allows reversal to be accomplished again without any problems.

There are certainly many applications for MinMaxScalerByte, and the one that immediately springs to mind is data compression. Scaling down results in smaller numbers and therefore shorter bit representations. For very long text sequences, a saving can certainly be achieved in this way.

MinMaxScalerByte is freely changeable as well as available. 
A small hint to my repository is enough.
