# MinMaxScalerBytes

MinMaxScalerByte scales numeric integer sequences down to their lower limit, and allows reversal to be accomplished again without any problems.

There are certainly many applications for MinMaxScalerByte, and the one that comes to mind spontaneously could possibly be data compression. It would have to be adapted specifically for this.

MinMaxScalerByte is freely changeable as well as available. 
A small reference to this repository is sufficient.
